# automata_wiki

This repository contains copies of the finite state machines (FSM) available in the [automata wiki website](https://automata.cs.ru.nl/).
Here you will also find scripts for parsing FSM models to different formats, such as:

- KISS format ( si -- in / out -> sj )
- FSMlib format (by [Michal Soucha](https://github.com/Soucha/FSMlib/blob/master/fsm_file_description.txt))

Additionally, you will find other scripts for generating statistics from FSM models.
